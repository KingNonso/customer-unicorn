Django admin server should now be accessible via [127.0.0.1/admin](http://127.0.0.1/admin)

### Project (Python/Django) + Unicorn

This project uses [Django-Unicorn](https://www.django-unicorn.com/) a magical full-stack framework for Django âœ¨ It
allows you to:  
* Quickly add in simple interactions to regular Django templates without learning a new templating language
* Unicorn progressively enhances a normal Django view, so the initial render of components is fast and great for SEO.
* Next, Unicorn binds to the elements you specify and automatically makes AJAX calls when needed.
* Then, Unicorn dynamically updates the DOM.

The end result is that you can focus on writing regular Django templates and Python classes without needing to switch to
another language or build unnecessary plumbing.


#### Other alternatives include

* Using REST APIS (django-rest-framework)
* Using Graphql (django-graphene)
* Using old plain Ajax
